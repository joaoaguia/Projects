# Projects
Welcome to my general repository! Here, you will find a collection of small projects that I have created using various programming languages. Each project is listed with its name and a brief summary of its functionality. Feel free to take a look around and try out the different applications.

Python:
Public_Job_Searcher - This is a script that uses Selenium to scrape job listings from a Portuguese government website (https://www.bep.gov.pt/pages/oferta/Oferta_Pesquisa_basica.aspx). The script uses Chrome as the webdriver and waits for a button on the website to load before clicking it. It then extracts data from the website such as job code, type of job, link, career, category, district, organization, qualifications required, job description, deadline, remuneration, and nationality requirements. The script then creates a table with the extracted data and saves it in an Excel file with the name "Extraction_dd_mm_yy.xlsx" where dd, mm, and yy are the current day, month and year. The script also includes a function that assigns each extracted data to a column in the table. Finally, it uses the Email_Sender library to send an email with the Excel file attached.
